## Usages
As of v0.3.0, `banner_nish` has one functionality that can be executed from command line: the `show-banner` command, which prints out a slanted ASCII-based banner that says the creator's (that is, my) nickname, nish. This functionality is implemented via its dependency `pyfiglet`.

```
$ show-banner

    _   ___      __
   / | / (_)____/ /_
  /  |/ / / ___/ __ \
 / /|  / (__  ) / / /
/_/ |_/_/____/_/ /_/

```
