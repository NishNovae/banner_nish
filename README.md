# banner_nish

## Usages
As of `v0.3.0`, `banner_nish` has one functionality that can be executed directly from the command line: the `show-banner` command, which prints out a slanted ASCII-based banner that says my nickname, Nish. This functionality is implemented via its dependency `pyfiglet`.

An example execution looks like this:
```
$ show-banner

    _   ___      __
   / | / (_)____/ /_
  /  |/ / / ___/ __ \
 / /|  / (__  ) / / /
/_/ |_/_/____/_/ /_/

```
